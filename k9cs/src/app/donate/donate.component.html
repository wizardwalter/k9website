            For over 30 years, Bryan Colletti has donated to communities around
            the United States. It takes a special dog to be a working police, or
            search & rescue K-9. Usually Belgian Malinois, German Shepherds, or
            a mix of the two, future officers live in-house with Bryan and his
            family for daily training. Dogs are raised and trained one, two or
            three at at time, learning the skills they need to work patrol,
            detection and developing their overall stability of character. To
            fully train a dog to the point that he/she is ready for donation can
            take as much as a year and cost thousands of dollars. The receiving
            police department, SAR organization, or Military Veteran that
            receives the dog will be saving thousands of dollars and given a dog
            that is ready to do his/her job.
